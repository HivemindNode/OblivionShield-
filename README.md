# OblivionShield.py  
_A real-time RF cloaking and defense system._  

### What It Does:  
- **Blocks RF fingerprinting to prevent device tracking**  
- **Uses adaptive noise to hide signals in random background interference**  
- **Disrupts hostile RF scans without exposing its own location**  
- **Prevents signal analysis from revealing network presence**  

### Who Is It For?  
_"A presence that cannot be traced is a presence that does not exist."_  

### How to Use:  
1. Deploy **OblivionShield** on a T-Embed CC1101 module  
2. Activate RF cloaking:  
   ```bash
   python3 OblivionShield.py --start
